# Project 2 - Automatic & Manual Distance Alarm System
- Takes in distance from an untrasonic distance sensor
- Activates alarm function if distance < threshold, or button is held down
- Alarm is flashing lights plus a loud buzzer
- Distance and more feedback info is available in the serial monitor of the Arduino IDE
