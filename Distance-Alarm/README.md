# Project 2 - Automatic & Manual Distance Alarm System
- Uses the new **ESP32S2 microcontroller**, code written in **Arduino IDE** in **C++**
- Takes in distance from an **ultrasonic distance sensor**
- Activates **alarm** function if distance < threshold, or **button** is held down
- Alarm is **flashing lights** plus a **loud buzzer**
- Buzzer can be silenced through **website** hosted on its **wireless access point**
- Distance and more feedback info is available in the **serial monitor** (terminal-like window) of the Arduino IDE

## Canvas Assignment Specifications:
### Project 2
Pick a problem or need and use Design Thinking to propose, develop and prototype an embedded design to solve that problem using an Arduino and using the techniques we have covered so far.
Required elements:
It must exhibit interaction by:
- Using at least two digital or analog inputs, using a least one that is not a button or switch
- Using at least two digital outputs, using at least one that is not an LED.

You must turn in your design on Canvas. You will also give a 5 minute presentation and demonstration of your design during class on October 25.

This will **not** be a team project.
___
### Presentation
As before, you must make a presentation to the class in addition to submitting documentation to Canvas

Your presentation must consist of the following elements:
- Statement of problem
- Discussion of design process, especially how it ties into Design Thinking
- Design result
- Demonstration
- Discussion of challenges and conquests
___
### Submission details
All projects must be submitted to Canvas by the due date
You are also required to make an in-class presentation
Your submission must include the following documentation:
- Statement of problem, overall description of design, and design process used (pdf)
